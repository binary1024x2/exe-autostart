# autostart.lua

This is a simple script for OBS that let's you start a program when you open OBS. Can be useful if you use programs like VSeeFace or Gazo Tuber. 

> **Note** This is tested on Windows. Should work on Linux and OSX, but is not properly tested.

## Install

Open OBS and go to `Tools -> Scripts`, click the **+** button and locate the `autostart.lua` file.

## Options

- `Program to launch`: the path to the program you want to launch.
- `Arguments`: the program arguments, if required.
- `Close program on exit`
- `Start program`: to test if the program is starting properly.
